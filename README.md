## About
The e-commerce website project provides a comprehensive range of features for both customers and administrators. The application includes options for both light and dark modes, catering to user preferences. Users can browse and sort products by category or price, add products to their cart, and register for an account or log in with their email and password. Logged-in customers can create new products, while administrators have the additional capabilities of creating, deleting, and editing products. The application also allows users to remove products from their cart and update the quantities of products within the cart. By developing this project, I gained a deeper understanding of the React lifecycle, state management with Redux, and authentication using JWT token in .NET. I also learned how to integrate TypeScript with React for improved error suggestions and connect the front-end with the back-end. This experience allowed me to apply various technologies in a real-world setting and understand how to integrate different components into a seamless and user-friendly application, contributing to my growth as a developer.
